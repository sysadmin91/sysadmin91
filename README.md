### MY INTRODUCTION ðŸ‘‹

Hi,

welcome to my Github profile!

I am Paul and I am a sysadmin (specifically an Application Support Specialist). 

I have worked since 2014 predominantly on Linux systems and Oracle products.


I like to learn new things and improve myself with new ideas.

At the moment in my free time, I am learning piano and DevOps and Cloud Computing.

I am interested in: Automation, Monitoring, Linux/Unix, DevOps, Cloud Computing, Oracle Databases, and other cool subjects.


I hope enjoy my profile and keep learning and stay hungry!
